    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <div className='boxedtext'>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Charles, and I'm a full-stack web developer with a diverse creative background. My journey into coding began in middle school with Scratch, a block-based coding language. I quickly found it intuitive and enjoyable, finishing all my computer science class assignments in just the first two weeks of the semester.

    In high school, I took another computer science course where we used Scratch again, but this time with a more open-ended project: creating a game. I decided to develop a Pok√©mon clone, a challenging task considering the complexity of the original games and the limitations of Scratch. Despite its bugs and the hand-drawn graphics, it remains one of my favorite projects to this day.

My creative pursuits extend beyond coding. I'm a true jack of all trades, exploring various forms of art. I ventured into solo music production, creating a Christmas album that allowed me to experiment with sound design and composition. This passion for combining different art forms naturally led me to game development, an area that integrates visual art, storytelling, sound design, and coding.

A few years later, I took an online course in 2D game development using Unity, where I joined the Game Dev Field Guide community on Discord. Participating in monthly game jams, I created my first solo game, "Steak Cuts." This experience was eye-opening, as it revealed my deep enjoyment in crafting engaging and intuitive user experiences. I realized that the challenge of creating seamless, user-centric designs was one of the things I enjoyed most about game development.

    <p>
This revelation guided me towards web development, which aligns perfectly with my passion for creating exceptional user experiences. Web development offers a dynamic platform where I can combine my technical skills with my creative flair to build interactive and impactful digital experiences. I pursued this path by completing a full-stack web development bootcamp through the University of Utah, earning my certificate and solidifying my commitment to this field.
    </p>
    <p>
I am incredibly excited about the future and the opportunities it holds. Whether it's building innovative web applications, exploring new technologies, or collaborating on creative projects, I am eager to bring my skills and passion to new challenges. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the potential to work together and create something extraordinary.
